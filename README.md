# Early Heart Attack Prediction using Flask

This project is an implementation of a machine learning model that predicts the likelihood of an early heart attack based on a set of input parameters. The model has been trained on a dataset containing various risk factors, and it achieves an accuracy of 91.8%.

## Prerequisites

To run this project, you will need:

- Python 3.6 or higher
- Flask
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- XGBoost

You can install these dependencies by running:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`


## Usage

To run the model, execute the following command:

`python3 -m flask run`

This will start the Flask server, and you can access the prediction form by visiting http://localhost:5000/ in your web browser.

## Models Used

The following models have been used for training the dataset:

- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Classifier
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree Classifier
- Random Forest Classifier
- Support Vector Machine (SVM) Classifier
- Gaussian Naive Bayes Classifier
- XGBoost Classifier
- Voting Classifier (Combination of all classifiers)
